# nyc-taxi-etl-pipeline
This project implements a complete, containerized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Spark and Docker. It processes raw NYC Yellow Taxi trip data, enriches it with location details, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database, making it ready for analytics and business intelligence.
